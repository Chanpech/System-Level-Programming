CS3411 Program II: Kernel and Block I/O

The program requires the following command line inputs. 
- copy <infile> <outfile> <blocksize>

The program will read the contents of the file in blocks
which can optionally be specified blocksize from the command line.
If not provided, blocksize will be default to 1024 bytes.
After the block will be read and computed by a checksum function 4 byte at a time.
The checksum implement a XOR computation on the four consecutive bytes and xored to the sum. 
In addition, during checksum computation if the partition block is not 4 byte modulo then it will be padded.
