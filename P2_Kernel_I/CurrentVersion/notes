Only use the padding for the chunks that is not 4 bytes
Perform read from the file and output should write to standard out. 
If we every issues a warning write to the standard error 
(such as when user give insufficient size file or wrong file).
Block should be 4 bytes if not give warning and round it up by padding to the right.
No printf -> Use syscall, by char buff. Read() & Write().
