The the prog1 hmalloc program will consists of
1. hmalloc.h
2. main.c
3. hmallo.c
4. Makefile

Goals:  
Design a hmalloc program that simulate some basic features of malloc system call. 
The features which the program will simulate are:
1.hmalloc
2.hfree
3.hcalloc
4.hrealloc

Hmalloc will use the sbrk system call to request memory from the operating system. Those call are:
    void *sbrk(intptr_t increment);
On success, sbrk() returns the previous program break. (If the break was increased, then this value is a pointer to the start of the newly allocated memory) 
On error, (void *) -1 is returned.
