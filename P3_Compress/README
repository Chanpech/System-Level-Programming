Place your compression ratios/comments here.
CR = (Vd + Vc) / Vc

In the input-file and input-file.new tested, the following are the initial value.
Vc = 394
Vd = 445
Plugging this into the equation above result in the following compression value.
2.1294 roughtly mean 2 : 1

Program files consists of: 
bitsy.c
bitsy.h
czy.c
dzy.c
Makefile

Goal of the program: 
Develop a program called czy which compresses the data stream directed at
its standard input and writes the compressed stream to its standard output and another program called dzy which decompresses a compressed stream directed at its standard input and writes decompressed data to its standard output.

Compression follows the followwing format: 
Infrequent/Unique byte with respect to previous 8 byte: 
<1> <symbol>
Frequent byte with respect to previous 8 byte: 
<0> <postion>
