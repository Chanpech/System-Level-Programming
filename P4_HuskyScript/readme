Create a script command.
./hscript <progam nam> <arguments> <directory>

Say ./hscript /usr/bin/ls -l -a -h test
hscript is the man in terminal that capture what happened between you and the terminal.
It captured in the test.

//open(diretory) with no truncate falg
Just error out if it output an unexpected value.
hscript will have to make a directory called out_dir that stores the stdin, stdout,stderror in files:
0,1, and 2.

All system call must be error checked.
System call we likely have to use:
int select(int nfds, fd_set *_Nullable restrict readfds,
                  fd_set *_Nullable restrict writefds,
                  fd_set *_Nullable restrict exceptfds,
                  struct timeval *_Nullable restrict timeout);

Program does not have to use signal() but will work if we do.
